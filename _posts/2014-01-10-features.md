* Suggests objects and files to document based on a priority ranking

* Undocumented methods and classes are not considered *bad* (they are given a special grade, because there is nothing to evaluate and maybe things were left undocumented intentionally)

* No hard rules, like "every method's documentation should be a single line under 80 characters not ending in a period"

* Inch let's you write your documentation the way you want

* Can handle all forms of inline docs, but was built with an emphasis on [YARD](http://yardoc.org/), [RDoc](http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/) and [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/)
