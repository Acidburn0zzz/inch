# TODOs

* Recognize all relevant options in .yardopts file
  * --plugin
  * --[no-]api API
* Provide reusable context that filters code objects according to the
  visibility options
* Add support for multiple signatures for methods
  (realized via the @overload tag in YARD)
* Make `inch lib/optparse.rb` work (without explicit `suggest`)
